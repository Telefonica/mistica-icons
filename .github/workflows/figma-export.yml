            🚨 **This pull request has been created automatically** 🚨

            Racine uses a GitHub action to sync the svg files for our icons from our [Mística Icons in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/JHuzksh01yxExMeMQBvymq/Beta-Mistica-Icons). This script runs everyday at 09:00.

            Whenever you need to release any icon changes into Mística Icons, you can merge this PR publishing a new version in production branch.

            **Be sure to take a look at the changes files to make sure everything is in order before merging.**
