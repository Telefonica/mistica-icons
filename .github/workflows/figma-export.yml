            🚨 **This pull request has been created automatically** 🚨

            Racine uses a GitHub action to sync the svg files for our icons from our [master icon kit in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/JHuzksh01yxExMeMQBvymq/Beta-Mistica-Icons). This script runs every 30 minutes.

            Whenever you need to release any icon changes into Mística Icons, you can merge this PR and publish a new version of the package.

            **Be sure to take a look at the changes files to make sure everything is in order before merging.**
